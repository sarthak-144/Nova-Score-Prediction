# Project-Nova ü§ñ

## Introduction

**Project-Nova** is a project that demonstrates the process of identifying and mitigating bias in a machine learning model. The project focuses on a scenario of predicting the creditworthiness of partners, where the initial dataset contains inherent biases based on gender and geographic location.


This notebook walks through the following key steps:
1.  **Generation of a biased dataset:** A synthetic dataset is created with intentional biases to simulate a real-world scenario.
2.  **Bias detection and analysis:** The biases in the dataset are verified and analyzed.
3.  **Model training:** A predictive model is trained on the biased dataset.
4.  **Bias mitigation:** A mitigation technique is applied to the model's predictions to ensure fairness.
5.  **Evaluation of mitigation impact:** The effect of the bias mitigation is analyzed and visualized.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Synthetic Data Generation:** Generates a custom dataset with controllable biases.
-   **Bias Verification:** Provides statistical verification of the introduced biases.
-   **Creditworthiness Prediction:** Trains a model to predict whether a partner is creditworthy.
-   **Bias Mitigation:** Implements a post-processing technique to mitigate bias in the model's predictions.
-   **Impact Visualization:** Visualizes the impact of the mitigation process, showing how many partners' classifications were changed to achieve fairness.

## üìä Results

The notebook generates several outputs, including:

-   A biased dataset saved as `nova_custom_biased_dataset.csv`.
-   Verification of biases in the dataset, showing disparities in earnings and GMV based on gender and location.
-   A visualization of the impact of bias mitigation in the form of a movement matrix, which shows how many partners were upgraded or downgraded to ensure fairness.

Here is an example of the mitigation impact matrix generated by the notebook:

This matrix clearly shows how many partners were moved from "Not Creditworthy" to "Creditworthy" and vice-versa after applying the bias mitigation technique.
